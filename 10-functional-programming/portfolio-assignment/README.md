# Your Portfolio for Class 10 - Functional Programming!

Scopes and closures and IIFE's, oh my! :grimacing:

Apply some functional programming concepts to your portfolio codebase.

 - Eliminate all `for` loops.  

 - Use `map` where you are transforming one collection into another.  

 - In at least one place, enclose the contents of a script file in an IIFE, that exports your high-level objects.  

 - Refactor any parts of your app that could be more loosely coupled. Make smaller functions that can accept and expect the  return values of other functions!  

 - Think of a useful way to use `reduce`. Maybe you want to put some "fun facts stats" in your footer?  

## Technical Requirements

- [x] Use of at least one .map() method.
- [x] Use of at least one .reduce() method.
- [x] IIFE present on at least one .js file.
