# Code 301, Class 8: ***SQL & Postgres***

*Databases power web applications everywhere by enabling them to persist, modify, and query datasets to great effect. While there are many types of database options available now, Structured Query Language (SQL) remains the de facto standard for communicating with relational database systems. Let's build some SQL skills!*

#### The next two days are different from previous days in this course with how the lab/portfolio assignments are structured. Let's go over that before we do anything else, so that we can see the big picture before diving into the content.

- View today's and tomorrow's classes and labs as a big two-part structure. It's all the same basic subject, but way too much for one day, so we've split it.
- There is **NO** portfolio assignment associated with today, so that means you can set that aside briefly (other than getting caught up...)
- Tomorrow morning is an extension of this afternoon's lab time. Plan to use it for lab rather than portfolio.
- Recommendation for this afternoon's lab time: study the code and get familiar with the big picture.
- Recommendation for tomorrow morning's lab time: work on the TODOs.
- The due date for Lab 8 **AND** Lab 9 will be Friday at 12:59p; in other words, you do not need to get today's lab completed by class time tomorrow. Focus on your learning and understanding of the concepts and code more so than trying to complete tasks. Take your time.

	- U = UPDATE
	- D = DESTROY (or DELETE)

- Relational Databases
		- Discuss differences between document based storage
		- Discuss common DBMS - MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc
		- Discuss concepts of relational data

- SQL
	- Syntax
	- Statements
	- Clauses
	- Constraints
	- Expressions
