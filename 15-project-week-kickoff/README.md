- Announcements
	- Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course) will be published late this afternoon and be available until 11:59pm Sunday. It is a graded portion of this course, regardless of your intent to advance to a 401 course.
  - Do not forget that the exam is open-book, open-Google, open-Stack_Overflow, whatever resources you want to use. The exam is designed to be, in spots, a little bit beyond what we have covered. The intent in those spots is to measure your resourcefulness and ability to adapt and figure something out. Be sure to leave yourself adequate time, like 1-2 hours depending if you are fast or slow on these kinds of things.
	- To help you prepare for that, there will be an **extra non-graded quiz** published in Canvas this afternoon. It will give you a little more practice to get ready for the exam.
	- Per usual, there will be a blackout on completing coursework during Project Week. You should have all of your lingering unfinished coursework submitted by no later than Monday morning at 8:59am.
	- Note that any unsubmitted assignments will be marked as a (temporary) zero on Monday. This is not punitive nor permanent: it is meant to be informative to show you where your grade would stand if you never submit that assignment.
	- To get any late work (or resubmits for higher grades) turned in after project week, make a plan for that with Sam and/or our Admissions team so they know what you're working on. Also be aware of how your work progress and grades overlap with admissions requirements and deadlines for upcoming 401 courses. Enrollments are running high and we are already establishing waitlists for upcoming 401s.
	- If you'd like to schedule a one-on-one meeting with Sam in the coming days, please select one of the slots available at [this link](https://sam-301d18.youcanbook.me/).

**Additional topics related to final projects**

- General API craziness
- [CORS & JSONP](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/cors-and-jsonp.html) • [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) • [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
- Heroku requires [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) to access external sites
- Async fun... it'll happen to you!
- Reminder: [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en)
- Reminder: [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
- The demo we did on the GitHub API would be useful if repurposed as an API sandbox to quickly get data to log into the console or view in the DOM, wouldn't it?
- Wanna do something cool and next-level? Go buy a domain name and point it at your Heroku deployment! Suggested site to use: [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) has a lot of $0.88 domains!

**Overall schedule from here on**

- Friday lab time:
	- Discuss project possibilities with your team
	- Begin testing/experimenting with APIs
	- Apply for API access if required! This is important if your API requires a key/token/etc.
	- As your ideas are coming together, bounce things off Sam & TAs to help manage project scope. Ideally these conversations can be held in group meetings with the entire team and all of the instructional staff, as much as possible

- Over the weekend
	- Continue reflecting on the scope of the project and what its MVP is
	- As needed, do any research into tech pieces or the problem domain
	- Maybe begin some wireframe sketches and/or problem domain diagrams
	- Do not forget to complete any lingering unfinished coursework by the Monday morning deadline
	- Do not forget the 401 exam which is due by 11:59pm Sunday night, and the two quizzes that you can take to help prepare (one of those quizzes is graded, the other is not)

- Monday morning
	- Get together with your team and complete the project proposal as outlined in the Day 16 README doc
	- Be sure to have a plan in place for your GitHub procedures within your team. Ideally this is written down or shared in a document as THE source of truth
	- In addition to the project itself, be sure to put together a plan for how your team will deconstruct it into tasks/TODO items
	- When your proposal is complete, meet with the instructional staff to get it reviewed and approved. After that you are ready to start building.

- Daily during project week
	- Standup meeting with instructional staff sometime during the morning
	- You should do at least one other standup with your team each day
	- You will have a daily report to fill out and submit in Canvas at the end of each day
	- Sam (except for one-on-one meeting times and any other regular CF meetings) and some subset of the TAs will be available to you between 9:00a and 6:00p each day.
- Presentation Day schedule is TBA as of right now. Once it is settled it will be communicated to you ASAP.
