# Class 12 - RESTful Endpoints and External APIs

*The focus of this day is on reinforcing the underlying concepts of the REST architectural style and  how to interact with application resources through the use of the HTTP verbs.  Students will need to know how to use jQuery AJAX methods, plus manage keys or tokens as needed, to make GET requests to external public APIs.*

- Project Week is coming! We'll have a quick discussion on project ideas TODAY to follow up on the Canvas discussion *(like, right meow, 15 minutes tops)* so that we can get a sense of how to scope them.
	- Tomorrow we'll continue discussing project ideas and start generating a list of possible projects, and announce project teams!
	-  Friday we'll get Project Week underway! Teams will be able to pick whatever project they want from a list of approved ideas, or propose a new one.

	- Let's look at a few recent final 301 projects from before your 201!
		- [Price I$ Right Parking](http://priceisrightparking.herokuapp.com/)
		- [Barkrawl](https://barkrawl.herokuapp.com/)
		- [Fremont Patroller](https://fremont-bike-patroller.herokuapp.com/)
		- [DroneStrike](https://whendronesattack.herokuapp.com/)
		- [Moviefinder](https://movfinder.herokuapp.com/)
		- [Crime City](http://crime-city.herokuapp.com/)
		- [Find My BikeTown](https://find-my-biketown.herokuapp.com/)

	- Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course, and is part of the grade for this course, so take even if not going into a 401) will be published on Friday afternoon and be available until 11:59pm Sunday.

	- There is also Quiz 3 to complete over the weekend, PLUS a bonus ***ungraded*** quiz 3.14 to help you prep for the 401 exam.

	- 	If you'd like to schedule a one-on-one meeting with Sam over the next week, please select one of the slots available at [this link](https://sam-301d18.youcanbook.me/).

[**Slides: RESTful endpoints and External APIs**](12-REST-APIs.pdf)

`BREAK (10 minutes)`

- "How I explained REST to my brother..."
- REST concepts
- RESTful routes
- App state and transition

**APIs**

- What
- Why
- How

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) is nice tool for inspecting API responses, such as from `http://swapi.co/api/people/4`. Try entering that into a browser, and then selecting the JSON option from the dropdown at the right. Is it hard to read? Then add JSONView to Chrome!

**Demo with the GitHub API**

- Clone [this repo](https://github.com/codefellows/code-301-github-api) that we'll use for building out an example

*(Continue/finish demo depending on time)*
