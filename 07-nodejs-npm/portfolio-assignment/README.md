## Your Portfolio for Class 7 - Give it a Node server!

Pretty simple adaptation for today's portfolio assignment: Set it up to run from a `server.js` file as we did with the blog app in lab.

This is a good day to get caught up on any lingering technical pieces of the portfolio.

Looking ahead to the portfolio assignment over the next few days:

- Class 8: There is no portfolio assignment! Use the time to catch up on any features where you're behind.
- Class 9: This will be a peer-code-review assignment with your lab partner.
- Class 10 + the weekend: You'll be adding in the rest of the technical features we added to the blog app this week.
